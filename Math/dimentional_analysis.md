Q: Is it necessary to non dimensionalize the governing equation before applying the perturbation methods?
A: Non-dimensionalizing alone may be misleading. If one of your variables is of magnitude 1000 and another one of magnitude 0.001 (before or after non-dimensionalizing does not matter) and perturbing both by an amount of 0.0001 then the effect is essentially that of non-perturbing the first variable, the result does nothing say about this variable. (Here, I assumed that perturbations are by an absolute amount, not a relative one.) So the point is to rescale the variables such a way that all variables have the same magnitude (and the size of perturbation is to be chosen according to the common magnitude). The process of rescaling may also non-dimensionalize the variables.

Q: Why does non-dimensionalization work?
A: Basically the idea is that numbers with units must necessarily respond in a simple way when we change our system of units. If, say, I change the basic unit of length to be twice as big, then all numbers with lengthk in their units will get divided by 2k accordingly.
